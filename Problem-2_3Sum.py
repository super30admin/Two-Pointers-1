# APPROACH 1: Optimal Solution
# Time Complexity : O(n^2), n: length of nums
# Space Complexity : O(n) : because of sorting
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# Any problem you faced while coding this : None
#
#
# Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
# 1. Sort the array - O(n lg n)
# 2. For each element of the array - first number, ensure it's not same as previous one.
# 3. Do Two sum like approach for second and third number.
# 4. If sum is 0, update second and third num such that they are not equal to previous and after elements respectively
