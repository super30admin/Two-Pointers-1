# Time Complexity : O(n^2) 
# Space Complexity : O(n) 
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# Three line explanation of solution in plain english:
# - Sort the nums. Initialize answer as set.
# - Run loop for every element except last two, Assign left and right index. 
# - Run while loop till left is less than right. Compare sum with zero and shrink left and right boundry accordingly.

# Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
