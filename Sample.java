Problem1 (https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)
// Time Complexity : O(N)
// Space Complexity : O(1)
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : NO

// You sort 0 and 2 1 will be automatically sorted push 0 on front and push
// 2 on high side using mid pointer
// Your code here along with comments explaining your approach

Problem2 (https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)

// Time Complexity : O(N^2)
// Space Complexity : O(1)
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : NO

// Sort the array 2 intutions ---> 1) easilly avoid duplicate 
// Can use two pointer with sorting configuration.
// a+b = -c find a,b satisfying -c 

Problem3 (https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

// Time Complexity : O(N)
// Space Complexity : O(1)
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : NO

// The water is limited by the minimum of the two height 
// you must move pointer of the lower height because u considered it 
// until you find a height which crosses the height of larger pillar.
