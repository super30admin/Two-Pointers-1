Problem: Container with Most Water
Time Complexity : O(n)
Space Complexity : O(1)

Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
We take two pointers, at end and the start. Then we calculate the area and shift the pointers accordingly.
If the width is increasing to maximize the area we need to choose the bar which has greater height.

Problem: 3 Sum
Time Complexity : O(nlog(n) + n^2) = O(n^2)
