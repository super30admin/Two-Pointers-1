# Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
# Using 3 pointers left, right and current pointer to keep track of 0, 1 and 2
# If current pointer = 0 swap left and current pointer and move both the pointers to right by 1
# If current pointer = 2 swap current pointer and right and move right pointer to left by 1
# Else move the current pointer
