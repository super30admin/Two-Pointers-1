/** The problem is known as Dutch National Flag Problem.
 * Time Complexity : O(N) we are passing through every element in array using index pointer
 * Space Complexity : O(1) since sorting is being done in place
 * Executed on leetcode? yes
 * Approach : start index is at beginning of array and moves to the right as soon as we encounter a zero
 * end index sits at the end of the array and it moves to the left as soon as we encounter a two.
 * so basically start and end index keep track of the next place where you can have a zero and 2 respectively.
 *
 * Algo: 
 * 1. if you get a nums[index]=0, swap nums[start] and nums[index]. increment both start and index
 * 2. if you get nums[index]=2, swap nums[end] and nums[index]. decrement end and dont do anything to index
 * because: suppose you have [0,1,2,0] and nums[start] =1 ; index is at nums[i] = 2 and nums[end] = 0, after we swap the array becomes [0,1,0,2]. now we cant do anything to index yet
 * we need to check if nums[start] and nums[index] have to be swapped, in this case, yes! we can do this in the next iteration.
 * 3. if nums[index] = 1, just increment index pointer
